# NLP-Emotion

Model Comparison Explanation:
Naive Bayes:

Suitability: Naive Bayes works well when feature independence is assumed, which is often the case in text classification tasks (like emotion classification). It is computationally efficient and works well with smaller datasets.
Advantages: Fast training and prediction times. Suitable for text data where the independence assumption holds reasonably well.
Disadvantages: Can struggle with more complex patterns or correlations in the data.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Suitability: SVM is effective for high-dimensional spaces (like TF-IDF vectors) and handles complex decision boundaries well, making it a good choice for text-based emotion classification.
Advantages: Works well with both linear and non-linear data (depending on the kernel). Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
Disadvantages: Can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
Which Model to Choose?
Naive Bayes is a good choice if speed and simplicity are your priority, especially for text classification tasks.
SVM often performs better for more complex datasets, particularly when there is non-linear decision-making required, but it can be slower.
